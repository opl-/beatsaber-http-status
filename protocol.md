# Beat Saber HTTP Status protocol

This document describes the protocol used by the Beat Saber HTTP Status plugin.

## Connecting

The web server by default runs on port `6557` (**B**eat **S**aber **ST**atus). Secure connections are currently not supported.

## Endpoints

### `GET /status.json`

Returns the [Status object](#status-object).

### `/socket`

Use this path to connect to the WebSocket. The WebSocket will send the [hello event](#hello-event) when connected and new [events](#events) as they happen.

## Standard objects

### Event object

```js
EventObject = {
	"event": String, // See [Events](#events)
	"status": Object, // See [Status object](#status-object). May be partial, depending on the event type.
}
```
