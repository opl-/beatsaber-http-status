# Beat Saber HTTP Status protocol

This document describes the protocol used by the Beat Saber HTTP Status plugin.

## Connecting

The web server by default runs on port `6557` (**B**eat **S**aber **ST**atus). Secure connections are currently not supported.

## Endpoints

### `GET /status.json`

Returns the [Status object](#status-object).

### `/socket`

Use this path to connect to the WebSocket. The WebSocket will send the [hello event](#hello-event) when connected and new [events](#events) as they happen.

## Standard objects

### Event object

```js
EventObject = {
	"event": String, // See [Events](#events)

### Beatmap event object

An explanation of the beatmap events system can be found here: <https://bsmg.wiki/mapping/basic-lighting.html>

Meanings of the different integer values can be derived from here: <https://github.com/Caeden117/ChroMapper/blob/master/Assets/__Scripts/Map/Events/MapEvent.cs>

```js
BeatmapEvent = {
	"type": Integer,
	"value": Integer,
}
```

## Events

Events are broadcasted over the WebSocket. For message format, see [Event object](#event-object).

### `hello` event

Sent when the client connects to the WebSocket server.

Contains the full [Status object](#status-object).

### `songStart` event

Fired when the `GameCore` scene is activated. In case of multiplayer, this is delayed until the countdown starts.

If the player is spectating at the beginning of the song, `game.scene` will be set to `Spectator` and only beatmap events will be fired.

If the player fails the map but other players are still alive, the `failed` event will be fired and the `menu` event will be delayed until after the map is over.

Contains the full [Status object](#status-object).

### `finished` event

Fired when the player finishes a beatmap.

Contains only the `performance` property of [Status object](#status-object).

### `softFailed` event

Fired when the player's energy counter reaches 0 but the player can continue playing (for example if the No Fail modifier is on).

After this event is fired, the `performance.softFailed` property of the [Status object](#status-object) will be set to `true` until the end of the map. Any properties that are affected by the modifier multiplier will also be updated accordingly (such as `mod.multiplier`, `beatmap.maxRank`, and `performance.currentMaxScore`, among others).

When the player completes the map after this event was fired, the `finished` event will be used to signal that.

Contains the `beatmap`, `performance` and `mod` properties of [Status object](#status-object).

### `failed` event

Fired when the player fails a beatmap.

Contains only the `performance` property of [Status object](#status-object).

### `menu` event

Fired when the `Menu` scene is activated. In case of multiplayer, this happens whenever the room enters the lobby.

Contains the full [Status object](#status-object).

### `pause` event

Fired when the beatmap is paused.

Contains only the `beatmap` property of [Status object](#status-object).

### `resume` event

Fired when the beatmap is resumed.

Contains only the `beatmap` property of [Status object](#status-object).

### `noteCut` event

Fired when a note is cut.

Contains only the `performance` property of [Status object](#status-object) and a `noteCut` property as described in [Note cut object](#note-cut-object).

Also see: [`noteFullyCut` event](#notefullycut-event).

### `noteFullyCut` event

Fired when the `AfterCutScoreBuffer` finishes, ie. the game finishes gathering data to calculated the cut exit score. The field `performance.lastNoteScore` is updated right before this event is fired. This even is not fired for bomb notes.

Contains only the `performance` property of [Status object](#status-object) and a `noteCut` property as described in [Note cut object](#note-cut-object).

### `noteMissed` event

Fired when a note is missed.

Contains only the `performance` property of [Status object](#status-object).

Contains the `noteCut` property with an object value as described in [Note cut object](#note-cut-object). Only the properties describing the note data will be set, leaving the cut and swing related properties with their default values.

### `bombCut` event

Fired when a bomb is cut.

Contains only the `performance` property of [Status object](#status-object) and a `noteCut` property as described in [Note cut object](#note-cut-object).

### `bombMissed` event

Fired when a bomb is missed.

Contains only the `performance` property of [Status object](#status-object).

Contains the `noteCut` property with an object value as described in [Note cut object](#note-cut-object). Only the properties describing the note data will be set, leaving the cut and swing related properties with their default values.

### `obstacleEnter` event

Fired when the player enters an obstacle.

Contains only the `performance` property of [Status object](#status-object).

### `obstacleExit` event

Fired when the player exits an obstacle.

Contains only the `performance` property of [Status object](#status-object).

### `scoreChanged` event

Fired when the score changes.

Contains only the `performance` property of [Status object](#status-object).

### `beatmapEvent` event

Fired when a beatmap event is triggered. Beatmap events include changing light colors, light rotation speed and moving the square rings.

Contains only a `beatmapEvent` property as described in [Beatmap event object](#beatmap-event-object).
